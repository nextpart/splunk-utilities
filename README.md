### Splunk Application Packaging

This packaging image (resp. role) is used, as the name suggests, to package and validate apps. For this purpose, there is the ``/apps`` folder, where the **source code of the application** is supplied, and the ``/dist`` folder or distribution, where the **finished package with the test reports** is then located when the container is finished with its task.

```bash
docker run -it \
    -v "`pwd`/apps/APP_FOLDER_NAME:/apps/APP_FOLDER_NAME" \
    -v "`pwd`/dist:/dist" \
    -e "MYUSER=`id -u`" \
    splunk-package:latest
```

It is also possible to map several apps into the directory and process them in bulk as the primary use case in the initial implementation was the usage in CI/CD pipelines.

The process is currently still very static but will be expanded soon so that more parameters can be passed for various use cases.

#### Parameter variables for packaging

* ``MYUSER``: Local user ID which should own the final ``dist``.
* ``APP_DIR``: Path to application source mapping (e.g. `Build.SourcesDirectory` for Azure Pipelines CI/CD purposes)
* ``PKG_DIR``: Path to distribution package mapping (e.g. `Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory` for Azure Pipelines CI/CD purposes)
* ``SPL_IGNORE``: Files (& wildcards) to be ignored in packaging process.
